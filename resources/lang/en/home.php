    'about_us' => '<b>PURPOSE</b>
    <br/>As foreign students coming from overseas, we originally had no idea that Okutama, a countryside, exists within the bounds of Tokyo. Over the course of our stay, we have come to appreciate the nature of Okutama and its culture through the various activities and events that we have participated into. We believe that it would be a opportunity wasted if Okutama remains unknown to many. Thus, we came up with Okutara.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>MEANING</b><br/>
    Okutara is a fusion of two words <b>Okutama</b> and <b>Tara</b>.<br/>
    <b>Tara</b> is a Tagalog word for Lets go. Hence, the message: Lets go to Okutama!
    <br/><br/>
    <b>VISION</b><br/>
    Through Okutara, we would like to reach more foreign audience overseas by sharing blogs/vlogs about our own Okutama experience! ',
